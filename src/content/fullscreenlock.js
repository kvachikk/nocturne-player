// Many film players take the screen for themselves when the phone is turned:
// on landscape they put their own element into fullscreen, on portrait they
// leave it. With our player open, either one took fullscreen away from the
// stage, which read exactly like the user backing out, and the player closed
// in the middle of the turn — leaving the film playing somewhere in the page.
//
// While the player is open, the page's calls to take or leave fullscreen are
// answered as if they had worked and otherwise ignored. Our own calls are not
// affected: a content script sees the browser's methods through its Xray
// wrappers, never the page's replacements.
